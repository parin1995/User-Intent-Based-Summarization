Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members.,0
"Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in the years ending in 1, 3, and 7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.",0
New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years.,0
"(The others are Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Virginia.)",0
"New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year.",0
"Thus, the last year when New Jersey elected a governor was 2017; the next gubernatorial election will occur in 2021.",0
The New Jersey Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six associate justices.,0
All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate.,0
"Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.",0
"Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.",0
More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county.,0
All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate.,0
"Each judge serves an initial seven-year term, after which he or she can be reappointed to serve until age 70.",0
"New Jersey's judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity, like its neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U.S. states.",0
"The New Jersey Superior Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is damages, while the Chancery Division hears family cases, civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief, and probate trials.",0
"The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division, which functions as the state's intermediate appellate court.",0
Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.,0
"There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction.",0
Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation.,0
"They also hear appeals on decisions made by the director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates.",0
Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court.,0
"Tax Court judges are appointed by the governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.",0
There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.,0
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era.,0
New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently Union County in 1857.,0
"New Jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called ""Freeholders"", governing each county as part of its own Board of Chosen Freeholders.",0
"The number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.",0
"Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or split into separate branches of government.",0
"In 16 counties, members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments.",0
"In the other five counties (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the Board of Chosen Freeholders retains a legislative and oversight role.",0
"In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.",0
"New Jersey currently has 565 municipalities; the number was 566 before Princeton Township and Princeton Borough merged to form the municipality of Princeton on January 1, 2013.",0
"Unlike other states, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality.",0
"In 2008, Governor Jon Corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs.",0
"In May 2009, the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation.",0
"Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented.",0
"This began with the Walsh Act, enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature, which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis.",0
"This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.",0
"The Faulkner Act, originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Small Municipality, and Mayor-Council-Administrator.",0
"The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters.",0
Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters.,0
Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature.,0
"While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public.",0
"For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, Loch Arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government.",0
"The other three villages—Ridgefield Park (now with a Walsh Act form), Ridgewood (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and South Orange (now operates under a Special Charter)—have all migrated to other non-village forms.",0
"Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation.",0
"Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as pro-choice, although a majority are opposed to late trimester and intact dilation and extraction and public funding of abortion.",0
"In a 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll, a plurality supported same-sex marriage 49% to 43% opposed, On October 18, 2013, the New Jersey Supreme Court rendered a provisional, unanimous (7–0) order authorizing same-sex marriage in the state, pending a legal appeal by Governor Chris Christie, who then withdrew this appeal hours after the inaugural same-sex marriages took place on October 21, 2013.",0
New Jersey also has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the U.S.,0
"These include bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and slingshots.",0
No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony.,0
BB guns and black-powder guns are all treated as modern firearms.,0
New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.,0
"In past elections, New Jersey was a Republican bastion, but recently has become a Democratic stronghold.",0
"Currently, New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senate, 26–14, and Assembly, 54–26), a 10–2 split of the state's twelve seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and both U.S. Senate seats.",0
"Although the Democratic Party is very successful statewide, the state has had Republican governors; from 1994 to 2002, Christine Todd Whitman won twice with 47% and 49% of the votes, respectively, and in the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie defeated incumbent Democrat Jon Corzine with 48% of the vote.",0
"In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Christie won reelection with over 60% of the votes.",0
"Because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the party's candidate for governor, the current governor and lieutenant governor are members of the Democratic Party.",0
"The governor's appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party; for instance, the attorney general is a Democrat.",0
"In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the Democratic Party.",0
"For many years in the past, however, it was a Republican stronghold, having given comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948, 1968, and 1976.",0
"New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960, 1968, and 1992.",0
The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was Clifford P. Case in 1979.,0
Newark Mayor Cory Booker was elected in October 2013 to join Robert Menendez to make New Jersey the first state with concurrent serving black and Latino U.S. senators.,0
"The state's Democratic strongholds include Camden County, Essex County (typically the state's most Democratic county—it includes Newark, the state's largest city), Hudson County (the second-strongest Democratic county, including Jersey City, the state's second-largest city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton), Middlesex County, and Union County (including Elizabeth, the state's fourth-largest city).",0
"The suburban northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean County and in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially Morris County, Sussex County, and Warren County.",0
"Other suburban counties, especially Bergen County and Burlington County had the majority of votes go to the Democratic Party.",0
"In the 2008 election, President Barack Obama won New Jersey with approximately fifty-seven percent of the vote, compared to McCain's forty-one percent.",0
Independent candidate Ralph Nader garnered less than one percent of the vote.,0
"About one-third of the state's counties are considered ""swing"" counties, but some go more one way than others.",0
"For example, Salem County, the same is true with Passaic County, with a highly populated Hispanic Democratic south (including Paterson, the state's third-largest city) and a rural, Republican north; with the ""swing"" township of Wayne in the middle.",0
"Other ""swing"" counties like Monmouth County, Somerset County, and Cape May County tend to go Republican, as they also have population in conservative areas, although Somerset has recently trended Democratic.",0
"To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 21 days prior to election day.",0
"On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey.",0

"Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death Row prisoners' sentences from ""Death"" to ""Life in Prison with No Parole"".",0
There is also a mineral museum Ogdensburg in Sussex County.,0
"Visitors and residents take advantage of and contribute to performances at the numerous music, theater, and dance companies and venues located throughout the state, including: New Jersey is the location of most of the boardwalks in the U.S., with nearly every town and city along the Jersey Shore area each having a boardwalk with various attractions, entertainment, shopping, dining, miniature golf, arcades, water parks with various water rides, including water slides, lazy rivers, wave pools, etc., and amusement parks hosting rides and attractions including roller coasters, carousels, Ferris wheels, bumper cars, teacups, etc.",0

"It has been translated as ""near the great hill"", ""by the blue hills"", ""at the little big hill"", or ""at the range of hills"", referring to the Blue Hills, or in particular the Great Blue Hill, which is located on the boundary of Milton and Canton.",0
"Alternatively, Massachusett has been represented as Moswetuset—from the name of the Moswetuset Hummock (meaning ""hill shaped like an arrowhead"") in Quincy, where Plymouth Colony commander Myles Standish (a hired English military officer) and Squanto (a member of the now disappeared Patuxet band of the Wampanoag peoples) met Chief Chickatawbut in 1621.",0

Massachusetts has the same position and powers within the United States as other states.,0
"John Adams in 1779 may have chosen the word for the second draft of what became the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution because unlike the word ""state"", ""commonwealth"" at the time had the connotation of a republic, in contrast to the monarchy the former American colonies were fighting against.",0
"(The name ""State of Massachusetts Bay"" appeared in the first—rejected—draft.)",0
"Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family such as the Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett.",0

Currency was another issue in the colonies.,0
In 1652 the Massachusetts legislature authorized John Hull to produce coinage (mintmaster).,0
"""The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including the pine tree shilling, for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical.""",0

"Most of Massachusetts has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers.",0
Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to Humid Subtropical climates.,0
"The warm to hot summers render the oceanic climate rare in this transition, only applying to exposed coastal areas such as on the peninsula of Barnstable County.",0
"The climate of Boston is quite representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer highs of around 81 °F (27 °C) and winter highs of 35 °F (2 °C), and is quite wet.",0
"Frosts are frequent all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing inland winds.",0

"As of August 2016, the EPA reports that Massachusetts has warmed by over two degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.1 degrees Celsius.",0
This is almost twice as much as the average for the contiguous United States.,0
Shifting temperatures also result in the shifting of rainfall patterns and the intensification of precipitation events.,0
"To that end, average precipitation in the Northeast United States has risen by ten percent from 1895 to 2011, and the number of heavy precipitation events has increased by seventy percent during that time.",0
These increased precipitation patterns are focused in the winter and spring.,0
Increasing temperatures coupled with increasing precipitation will result in earlier snow melts and subsequent drier soil in the summer months.,0
The shifting climate in Massachusetts will result in a significant change to the built environment and ecosystems.,0
"In Boston alone, costs of climate change-related storms will result in 5 to 100 billion dollars in damage.",0

"For example, up to a 100-dollar rebate can be obtained for upgrading to an ENERGY STAR certified smart or programmable thermostat.",0
"Other appliances such as water heaters, air conditioners, washers and driers, and heat pumps are eligible for additional rebates.",0
The concept of Mass Save was created in 2008 by the passing of the Green Communities Act of 2008 during Deval Patrick’s tenure as governor.,0
"The main goal of the Green Communities Act was to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the State and to encourage new, more efficient technologies.",0
"Among others, one result of this act was a requirement for Program Administrators of utilities to invest in saving energy, as opposed to purchasing and generating additional energy where economically feasible.",0
"In Massachusetts, eleven Program Administrators, including NSTAR, National Grid, Western Massachusetts Electric, Cape Light Compact, Until, and Berkshire Gas, jointly own the rights to this program, in conjunction with the MA Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC).",0
"Mass Save also conducts no-cost in-home energy assessments so that homeowners, renters, and small business owners may educate themselves about energy efficiency-related home improvements and find opportunities to save money and energy.",0
"During the home assessment, Mass Save provides ENERGY STAR certified LED light bulbs, power strips, low flow showerheads, faucet aerators, and efficient thermostats free of charge.",0
"Additionally, air leaks will be detected in the home or building and patched, and recommendations will be made to install additional insulation to decrease the loss of heated or cooled air.",0
Discounts of 75 percent or more are available on these insulation improvements.,0
"Due to COVID-19, Mass Save is currently conducting assessments remotely.",0
Residents can schedule a remote assessment using the program's website or phone line.,0
The State Revenue Service provides incentives for the installation of solar panels.,0
"In addition to the Federal Residential Renewable energy credit, Massachusetts residents may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 15 percent of the project.",0
"Once installed, arrays are eligible for net metering.",0
"Certain municipalities will offer up to $1.20 per watt, up to 50 percent of the system’s cost on PV arrays 25 kW or less.",0
"The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources also offers low-interest, fixed-rate financing with loan support for low-income residents.",0
"This program is currently set to terminate on December 31, 2020.",0
"As a part of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources’ effort to incentivize the usage of renewable energy, the MOR-EV, or Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles initiative was created.",0
"With this incentive, residents may qualify for a State incentive of up to $2,500 dollars for the purchase or lease of an electric vehicle, or $1,500 for the purchase or lease of a plug-in hybrid vehicle.",0
This rebate is available in addition to the tax credits offered by the United States Department of Energy for the purchase of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.,0
"For income-eligible residents, Mass Save has partnered with Massachusetts Community Action Program Agencies and Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN) to offer residents assistance with upgrades to their homes that will result in more efficient energy usage.",0
"Residents may qualify for a replacement of their heating system, insulation installation, appliances, and thermostats if they meet the income qualifications provided on Mass Save’s website.",0
"For residents of 5+ family residential buildings, there are additional income-restricted benefits available through LEAN.",0
"If at least 50 percent of the residents of the building qualify as low income, energy efficiency improvements like those available through Mass Save are available.",0
"Residential structures operated by non-profit organizations, for profit operations, or housing authorities may take advantage of these programs.",0
"In late 2020, the Baker Administration released a Decarbonization Roadmap that aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.",0
The plan calls for major investments in offshore wind and solar energy and would require all new automobiles sold to be zero-emissions (electric or hydrogen powered) by 2035.,0

Massachusetts is the fastest-growing state in New England and the 25th fastest-growing state in the United States.,0
Population growth was largely due to a relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system in the state.,0
"Foreign immigration is also a factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower).",0
"40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia.",0
Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent.,0
Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010.,0

Marsh had been forced against his will to join Micheltorena's army.,0
"Ignoring his superiors, during the battle, he signaled the other side for a parlay.",0
There were many settlers from the United States fighting on both sides.,0
He convinced these men that they had no reason to be fighting each other.,0

"The Republic's only president was William B. Ide, who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt.",0
This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.,0
The California Republic was short lived; the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican–American War (1846–48).,0

The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico.,0
"In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.",0
"In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.",0

"The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento.Once the state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to statehood.",0
"On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California became a free state and September 9 a state holiday.",0
"During the American Civil War (1861–1865), California sent gold shipments eastwards to Washington in support of the Union.",0
"However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort.",0

"Before and after the U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy.",0
In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative.,0
"It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century.",0
Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century.,0
"As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54.",0
"With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences.",0
Texas has led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product.,0
"If Texas were a sovereign state, it would have the 10th largest economy in the world.",0
"The name Texas, based on the Caddo word táyshaʼ (/tʼajʃaʔ/) ""friend"", was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas, by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy, the final -s representing the Spanish plural.The Mission San Francisco de los Tejas was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in May 1690, in what is now Houston County, East Texas.",0
"During Spanish colonial rule, in the 18th century, the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas (""New Philippines"") and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas (""New Kingdom of the Philippines""), or as provincia de los Tejas (""province of the Tejas""), later also provincia de Texas (or de Tejas), (""province of Texas"").It was incorporated as provincia de Texas into the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared a republic in 1836.",0
"The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes both spellings, Tejas and Texas, as Spanish-language forms of the name of the U.S. State of Texas.",0
"The English pronunciation with /ks/ is unetymological, and based in the value of the letter x in historical Spanish orthography.",0
"Alternative etymologies of the name advanced in the late 19th century connected the Spanish teja ""rooftile"", the plural tejas being used to designate indigenous Pueblo settlements.",0
"A 1760s map by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin shows a village named Teijas on Trinity River, close to the site of modern Crockett.",0
Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas.,0
"Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact.",0
"These were: When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Native peoples divided into many smaller tribes.",0
"They were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan.",0
"The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast.",0
"At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the Aranama, lived in southern Texas.",0
"This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct.",0
It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally.,0
"By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century.",0
"It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.",0
"No culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.",0
"Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the Alabama, Apache, Atakapan, Bidai, Caddo, Aranama, Comanche, Choctaw, Coushatta, Hasinai, Jumano, Karankawa, Kickapoo, Kiowa, Tonkawa, and Wichita.",0
"The name Texas derives from táyshaʔ, a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai, which means ""friends"" or ""allies"".",0
"The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution.",0
"They were not particularly kind to their native populations—even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French.",0
"When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony.",0
"After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance.",0
The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas.,0
"The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land.",0
"Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it, the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas.",0
"They included the Muscogee, Houma Choctaw, Lenape and  Mingo Seneca, among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.",0
Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land.,0
"Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game.",0
Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.,0
"During the Texas Revolution, the U.S. became heavily involved.",0
Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations.,0
"At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread.",0
"The Caddoans were always clueless when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense.",0
It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties—preferably on the side of the Spanish.,0
"While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check.",0
"Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.",0
"By the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears.",0
"Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west.",0
This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas.,0
"Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements.",0
This began the movement of Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory—modern-day Oklahoma.,0
"The first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda.",0
"Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas.",0
"Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, ""half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.""",0
Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas: Francisco Vázquez de Coronado describes his 1541 encounter: European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685.,0
Miscalculations by René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle resulted in his establishing the colony of Fort Saint Louis at Matagorda Bay rather than along the Mississippi River.,0
The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.,0
"In 1690 Spanish authorities, concerned that France posed a competitive threat, constructed several missions in East Texas.",0
"After Native American resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico.",0
"When France began settling Louisiana, mostly in the southern part of the state, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas.",0
"Two years later, they created San Antonio as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.",0
Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area.,0
It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces.,0
"In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai.",0
The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes.,0
"With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes.",0
By the end of the 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity.,0
"When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas.",0
"The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819, at what is now the border between Texas and Louisiana.",0
"Eager for new land, many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement.",0
Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River.,0
"In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico.",0
"Due to its low population, Mexico made the area part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas.",0
"Hoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant Comanche raids, Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain.",0
"Under the Mexican immigration system, large swathes of land were allotted to empresarios, who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and the Mexican interior.",0
"The first grant, to Moses Austin, was passed to his son Stephen F. Austin after his death.",0
"Austin's settlers, the Old Three Hundred, made places along the Brazos River in 1822.",0
"Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority of whom were from the United States.",0
The population of Texas grew rapidly.,0
"In 1825, Texas had about 3,500 people, with most of Mexican descent.",0
"By 1834, the population had grown to about 37,800 people, with only 7,800 of Mexican descent.",0
"Most of these early settlers who arrived with Austin and soon after were persons less than fortunate in life, as Texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in Mexico and the United States during that time.",0
"Early Texas settler David B. Edwards described his fellow Texans as being ""banished from the pleasures of life"".",0
"Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law, especially the prohibition against slavery.",0
"Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States.",0
Illegal immigration from the United States into Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas anyway.,0
New laws also called for the enforcement of customs duties angering native Mexican citizens (Tejanos) and recent immigrants alike.,0
"The Anahuac Disturbances in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule, and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.",0
Texians sided with the federalists against the current government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas.,0
They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom.,0
"Texians met at the Convention of 1832 to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues.",0
"The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the Convention of 1833.",0
"Within Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists.",0
"In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety.",0
The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales.,0
"This launched the Texas Revolution, and over the next two months the Texians defeated all Mexican troops in the region.",0
"Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government.",0
"The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836.",0
"During this time of political turmoil, Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna personally led an army to end the revolt.",0
The Mexican expedition was initially successful.,0
General José de Urrea defeated all the Texian resistance along the coast culminating in the Goliad massacre.,0
"Santa Anna's forces, after a thirteen-day siege, overwhelmed Texian defenders at the Battle of the Alamo.",0
News of the defeats sparked panic among Texas settlers.,0
"The newly elected Texian delegates to the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas.",0
"After electing interim officers, the Convention disbanded.",0
"The new government joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape, fleeing from the approaching Mexican army.",0
"After several weeks of retreat, the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto.",0
"Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war.",0
"The Constitution of the Republic of Texas prohibited the government from restricting slavery or freeing slaves, and required free people of African descent to leave the country.",0
"While Texas had won its independence, political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic.",0
"The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean.",0
"Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans.",0
The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War.,0
"With wide popular support, Texas first applied for annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slaveholding country caused its admission to be controversial and it was initially rebuffed.",0
"This status, and Mexican diplomacy in support of its claims to the territory, also complicated Texas's ability to form foreign alliances and trade relationships.",0
"The Comanche Indians furnished the main Native American opposition to the Texas Republic, manifested in multiple raids on settlements.",0
Mexico launched two small expeditions into Texas in 1842.,0
The town of San Antonio was captured twice and Texans were defeated in battle in the Dawson massacre.,0
"Despite these successes, Mexico did not keep an occupying force in Texas, and the republic survived.",0
The cotton price crash of the 1840s depressed the country's economy.,0
"As early as 1837, the Republic made several attempts to negotiate annexation with the United States.",0
"Opposition within the republic from the nationalist faction, along with strong abolitionist opposition within the United States, slowed Texas's admission into the Union.",0
Texas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K. Polk won the election of 1844.,0
"On December 29, 1845, Congress admitted Texas to the U.S. as a constituent state of the Union.",0
"The population of the new state was quite small at first, and there was a strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers who dominated in the state's eastern/northeastern portions and the Spanish-speaking former Mexicans (Tejanos) who dominated in the state's southern and western portions.",0
Statehood brought many new settlers.,0
"Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of Longhorn cattle that roamed the state.",0
"Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous.",0
"After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States.",0
"While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty.",0
"While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so.",0
"President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846.",0
A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War.,0
"The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma.",0
"After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.",0
"After a series of United States victories, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year war.",0
"In return, for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the Mexican Cession in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande.",0
The Compromise of 1850 set Texas's boundaries at their present form.,0
U.S.,0
"Senator James Pearce of Maryland drafted the final proposal where Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and small portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming to the federal government, in return for the assumption of $10 million of the old republic's debt.",0
Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.,0
"They also brought or purchased enslaved African Americans, whose numbers tripled in the state from 1850 to 1860, from 58,000 to 182,566.",0
Texas was at war again after the election of 1860.,0
"At this time, blacks comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved.",0
"When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union.",0
Five other Lower South states quickly followed.,0
"A State Convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861.",0
"On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the Convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession from the United States.",0
"Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861.",0

"While far from the major battlefields of the American Civil War, Texas contributed large numbers of men and equipment to the rest of the Confederacy.",0
"Union troops briefly occupied the state's primary port, Galveston.",0
"Texas's border with Mexico was known as the ""backdoor of the Confederacy"" because trade occurred at the border, bypassing the Union blockade.",0
"The Confederacy repulsed all Union attempts to shut down this route, but Texas's role as a supply state was marginalized in mid-1863 after the Union capture of the Mississippi River.",0
"The final battle of the Civil War was fought near Brownsville, Texas at Palmito Ranch with a Confederate victory.",0
Texas descended into anarchy for two months between the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia and the assumption of authority by Union General Gordon Granger.,0

"President Johnson, in 1866, declared the civilian government restored in Texas.",0
"Despite not meeting reconstruction requirements, Congress resumed allowing elected Texas representatives into the federal government in 1870.",0
Social volatility continued as the state struggled with agricultural depression and labor issues.,0
"Like most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War.",0
"However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly.",0
The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory.,0
"The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, war tensions, or other problems.",0
"Indeed, ""Gone to Texas"" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states.",0
"Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well.",0
"The cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable.",0
Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state.,0
Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas and the rest of the U.S. (and the rest of the world) expanded.,0

"The resulting ""oil boom"" transformed Texas.",0
Oil production eventually averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972.,0
"In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites and Latinos.",0
"In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process.",0
"The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties.",0
"The Socialist Party became the second-largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs.",0
The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to U.S. involvement in World War I.,0

"World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture.",0
"Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.",0
Texas modernized and expanded its system of higher education through the 1960s.,0
"The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education, funded in large part by oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently.",0
These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.,0

"By 1990, Hispanics and Latin Americans overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.",0
"During the late 20th century, the Republican Party replaced the Democratic Party as the dominant party in the state, as the latter became more politically liberal and as demographic changes favored the former.",0
"Beginning in the early 21st century, metropolitan areas including Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Austin became centers for the Texas Democratic Party in statewide and national elections as liberal policies became more accepted in urban areas.",0

Texas is in the south central part of the United States of America.,0
Three of its borders are defined by rivers.,0
"The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south.",0
The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north.,0
The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east.,0
"The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a northern border with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32° N and the Rio Grande.",0
"With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.",0
"One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.",0
The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state.,0
Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods.,0
The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest.,0
The Cross Timbers region and Caprock Escarpment are part of the Interior Lowlands.,0
The Great Plains region in central Texas spans through the state's panhandle and Llano Estacado to the state's hill country near Austin.,0
This region is dominated by prairie and steppe.,0
"""Far West Texas"" or the ""Trans-Pecos"" region is the state's Basin and Range Province.",0
"The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.",0
"Texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers, with the Rio Grande as the largest.",0
"Other major rivers include the Pecos, the Brazos, Colorado, and Red River.",0
"While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built more than a hundred artificial reservoirs.",0
"The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both.",0
"The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States.",0
"Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of the Deep South, to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest.",0
"Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico.",0
The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.,0
"The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.",0
"These Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso.",0
Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks.,0
"The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.",0
This margin existed until Laurasia and Gondwana collided in the Pennsylvanian subperiod to form Pangea.,0
This is the buried crest of the Appalachian Mountains–Ouachita Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision.,0
This orogenic crest is today buried beneath the Dallas–Waco–Austin–San Antonio trend.,0
The late Paleozoic mountains collapsed as rifting in the Jurassic period began to open the Gulf of Mexico.,0
"Pangea began to break up in the Triassic, but seafloor spreading to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and late Jurassic.",0
The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form.,0
Today 9 to 12 miles (14 to 19 km) of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are here.,0
"At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age.",0
"These salt deposits formed salt dome diapirs, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast.",0
East Texas outcrops consist of Cretaceous and Paleogene sediments which contain important deposits of Eocene lignite.,0
"The Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments in the north; Permian sediments in the west; and Cretaceous sediments in the east, along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf contain oil.",0
Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area.,0
A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer.,0
"Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes.",0
A wide range of animals and insects live in Texas.,0
"It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all.",0
At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.,0
"Texas plays host to several species of wasps, including an abundance of Polistes exclamans, and is an important ground for the study of Polistes annularis.",0
"During the spring Texas wildflowers such as the state flower, the bluebonnet, line highways throughout Texas.",0
"During the Johnson Administration the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, worked to draw attention to Texas wildflowers.",0
The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather.,0
