"In 2000 the value of oil and gas produced was $8.2 billion, and in 2006, New Mexico accounted for 3.4% of the crude oil, 8.5% of the dry natural gas, and 10.2% of the natural gas liquids produced in the United States.",0
"However, the boom in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling beginning in the mid-2010s led to a large increase in the production of crude oil from the Permian Basin and other U.S. sources; these developments allowed the United States to again become the world's largest producer of crude oil in 2018.",0
"New Mexico's oil and gas operations contribute to the state's above-average release of the greenhouse gas methane, including from a national methane hot spot in the Four Corners area.",0

GRT is imposed by the state and there may an additional locality component to produce a total tax rate.,0

"The pre-Columbian trade with Mesoamerican cultures included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper.",1
"Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the Rio Grande.",1

The route was called El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.,0
The Santa Fe Trail was the 19th-century territory's vital commercial and military highway link to the Eastern United States.,1
"All with termini in Northern New Mexico, the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the Old Spanish Trail are all recognized as National Historic Trails.",0
New Mexico's latitude and low passes made it an attractive east–west transportation corridor.,1
"As a territory, the Gadsden Purchase increased New Mexico's land area for the purpose of the constructing a southern transcontinental railroad, that of the Southern Pacific Railroad.",1
"Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.",0
The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails but brought on a population boom.,0
Early transcontinental auto trails later crossed the state bringing more migrants.,1
Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports.,0
"Today, New Mexico's Interstate Highways approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.",1
New Mexico has only three Interstate Highways.,0
"In Albuquerque, I-25 and I-40 meet at a stack interchange called The Big I.",0

The system runs from Belen to downtown Santa Fe.,0
Larger cities in New Mexico typically have some form of public transportation by road; ABQ RIDE is the largest such system in the state.,0
"There were 2,354 route miles of railroads in the year 2000; this number increased with the opening of the Rail Runner's extension to Santa Fe.",0
"In addition to local railroads and other tourist lines, the state jointly owns and operates a heritage narrow-gauge steam railroad, the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway, with the state of Colorado.",0

"The service now connects Santa Fe, Sandoval, Bernalillo, and Valencia counties.",0
The trains connect Albuquerque's population base and central business district to downtown Santa Fe with up to eight roundtrips in a day.,0
The section of the line running south to Belen is served less frequently.,0
Rail Runner operates scheduled service seven days per week.,0
With the rise of rail transportation many settlements grew or were founded and the territory became a tourist destination.,0
"As early as 1878, the ATSF promoted tourism in the region with emphasis on Native American imagery.",0
"Named trains often reflected the territory they traveled: Super Chief, the streamlined successor to the Chief; Navajo, an early transcontinental tourist train; and Cavern, a through car operation connecting Clovis and Carlsbad (by the early 1950s as train 23–24), were some of the named passenger trains of the ATSF that connoted New Mexico.",0

No less than six daily long-distance roundtrip trains supplemented by many branch line and local trains served New Mexico in the early 1960s.,0
"Declines in passenger revenue, but not necessarily ridership, prompted many railroads to turn over their passenger services in truncated form to Amtrak, a state owned enterprise.",0
"Amtrak, also known as the National Passenger Railroad Corporation, began operating the two extant long-distance routes in May 1971.",0

It also operates on New Mexico Rail Runner Express trackage.,0
The Southwest Chief is the successor to the Super Chief and El Capitan.,0
"The streamliner Super Chief, a favorite of early Hollywood stars, was one of the most famous named trains in the United States and one of the most esteemed for its luxury and exoticness—train cars were named for regional Native American tribes and outfitted with the artwork of many local artists—but also for its speed: as few as 39 hours 45 minutes westbound.",0
